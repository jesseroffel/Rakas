# Sampo Game Framework

Personal project where I implemented a small custom game engine with topics I would like to learn from and to be used to create small basic 2D/3D games.

Currently this project is on hold and should resume before summer 2020.



## Features to be implemented

This is the initial list to be implemented, these are topics I would like to implement myself as part of my self development. 

* Core:
  * Input (Keyboard/Mouse/Gamepad)
  * Custom Logger
  * Config Reader
  * Event System
  * Timer
  * Math library
* Memory
  * Custom Memory Allocators
* Multi-Threading
  * Job System
  * Threads
* IMGUI UI
  * Console
  * Performance
* Renderer
  * Abstraction API
  * Basic Shaders
  * Basic Lighting



### Extras

Other topics I want to focus on with this project:

* Build integration with either `Premake5` or `CMake`
* Automated commit testing using `github/workflows`
* Platform abstraction to allow for other platform implementations.
